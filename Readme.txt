Hi... I'm getting back to simple algorithmical exercies.
Here I'm giving various solutions, some of them better, in my opinion, than requested by sites like Hacker Rank.

So. The fastest algoritm is with small temp array (size equal to shift). 
The most beautiful algoritm is the slowest. It's algoritm with cyclical shift.
In the middle it the simpliest copy in a new array. Relatively fast, but ugly. 

See performance test.
